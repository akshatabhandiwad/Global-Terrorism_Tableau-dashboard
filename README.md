# Global-Terrorism - Tableau Dashboard

Terrorism is a global threat in which thousands of people lose their lives. As there is an increase in such acts around the world, finding the root cause and the places where such acts are happening the most will help in achieving global peace and safety of the people. Through this project, we aim to create an interactive platform to spread the awareness.

The raw data was downloaded from the [Global Terrorism Database (GTD)](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/). The data wrangling and manipulation was carried out in .rmd format of R programming language. 

The final Tableau dashboard can be accessed [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/akshata.bhandiwad/viz/GlobalTerrorismAwareness/Group4).
